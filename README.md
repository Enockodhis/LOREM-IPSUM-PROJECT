# LOREM-IPSUM-PROJECT
"Lorem Ipsum" is a placeholder text commonly used in the graphic design, printing, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. The text is a scrambled version of a passage from a work by Cicero, a Roman statesman and philosopher, titled "De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil), written in 45 BC.

The generated texts are a mixture of slightly altered Latin words, with certain passages altered to make it nonsensical in terms of content, yet maintaining a semblance of Latin structure and word length to simulate a natural-looking text flow.
